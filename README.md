# ironworks.css

This is a fork of [concrete.css](https://concrete.style) to make certain changes stylistically and to add more components to it

## Updates

Listed below are the changes made in difference to `concrete.css`

- The spacing between the `<header>` and following `<section>` tags has been reduced to `4rem`.
- The font used for headings `--font-h` is now "Departure Mono".
- Minimal classes for adding sidenote menu in the form of the `sidemenu` and `sidemenu-left` classes for divs.
- `<aside>` tags now act as sidenotes (no numbering for them).
- The light accent colour has been changed to `whitesmoke` as I don't like having extreme white as an accent or background.
- Figure captions are now italicised.
